Summary Analysis
PyCity School analysis gives data on multiple public and charter schools such as their student population and budget.
It also gives further detailed information the overall student population, such as their grade level, gender, reading scores, and math scores.
Through this analysis, we have summarized each of the schools' student population, budget, and percentage passing math and reading. 
	For example, Rodriguez High School (District) is the worst school in percentage of students overall passing both math and reading.
	While Cabrera High School (Charter) has the highest percentage of students overall passing in math and reading. 
We have also determined the percentage of budget spent per student by each of the schools and how it correllates to their grades. 
As well as the scores based on school population and school type.

Conclusions
By far, charter school students have the best overall percentage in passing both math and reading.
We know that it is related to the size of the school, as the schools in the top 5 are either medium or smaller sized schools.
However, it does not mean that the size of the school directly corellates to overall percentage passing,
as even the smallest charter school falls in 5th place in terms of percantage passing.

We also conclude that the school spending range in students tend to result in a lower overall passing scores.
